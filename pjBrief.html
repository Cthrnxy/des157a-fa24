    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>My final project is Every Picture. I will set up more photos and add a user action to give the user an immersive train for the trip.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>For my Every Picture project, I will add more pictures on it, and set up the start point which is Guangzhou. It is me and my friends' hometown. When we travel somewhere in China, we depart from Guangzhou. So I add some pictures about Guangzhou to means the trip haven't start yet then the user can scroll down the to move the train on below when the train moving from right to left, the pictures will be changed which are match with the ticket show in the middle. I plan to make a sound effect and an animation about the window scene moving when the train is moving as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Expert Feedback</h3>
    <p>In terms of expert feedback, I asked my professor how the window scene moving works. And how to set up the pictures group.
