                All my photos are of one type. This is is one of the tickets for my friend's trip this year. The ticket has a lot of information on it, including the origin and destination and the time of the train. My friend's personal information. The journey is also an important part of traveling and behind the tickets are great memories of my friends. I design the ticket and photos of their departure and destination to show specific scenes as the user zooms in on the details of the ticket.

                The image by Zilin shows a shaded pathway lined with trees in fall colors, with leaves ranging from green to orange, as if painting a picture of autumn. The most interesting aspect is the symmetry created by the trees on either side of the path, making one feel guided forward, as if the path is full of stories and possibilities to explore. The different colors of the leaves intertwine to create a warm and vibrant atmosphere. The most obvious aspects are the fall colors and the sense of the trail's extension; the changing colors of the leaves and the neat arrangement of the trees make the trail stand out from view. And perhaps the most mysterious aspect lies at the end of the trail, where we can't see the end, which adds a sense of the unknown and makes you wonder what kind of view or story lies ahead.

                After reading the article 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills, I have a whole new appreciation for the ways in which reading and thinking skills can be developed through photographs. I tend to be accustomed to comprehending information through text, and this article made me realize that visuals can be just as powerful a guide to thinking and analysis. There are so many details hidden in each of the photographs within. It made me think about the stories and context behind the photos. Photographs are not only a form of artistic expression, but also an effective tool to enhance our critical thinking and interpretation skills. By practicing visual interpretation, we are able to understand the world better and are more able to empathize and respect different points of view.

                Both articles from Nielsen Norman Group and UX Planet discuss how to effectively use overlays, modals and dialog windows. They agree that these elements should be useful, not annoying. The Nielsen Norman Group suggests considering who the user is, what the overlay displays, and why it's needed to ensure it meets the user's needs. Patterns should be clear, easy to understand, and work well on both desktop and mobile screens. Both articles emphasize the need to make modals accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. In conclusion, modal panels are useful for grabbing attention or sharing important information, but they must be used with care and designed to fit naturally into the user's process.

                I learned a lot after reading this article. Simple information entry needs to follow rules. The user interface needs to prompt the user about the information and specifications that need to be filled in, otherwise then the end will get messy data. The interface also needs to focus on the user experience and how to give the user a good experience without getting bored when they are faced with a lot of information to fill in. Minimize input fields, step-by-step processing of long forms. Questions tend to range from the simple to the complex, and filling in content often starts with first name and last name. Guide the user through the steps. In simple forms, markers are needed to maintain the user's patience with the necessary information. In a large number of questions, the fill-in box form can guide the user. I don't like the restriction of password formatting when filling out information on websites, even if it is for user security. Most people use the same password for all websites, which is easy to remember. But the restriction of the format would make me break my memory. I have a hard time remembering my password after setting up a new one according to the site's requirements.
