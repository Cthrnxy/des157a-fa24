                Both articles from Nielsen Norman Group and UX Planet discuss how to effectively use overlays, modals and dialog windows. They agree that these elements should be useful, not annoying. The Nielsen Norman Group suggests considering who the user is, what the overlay displays, and why it's needed to ensure it meets the user's needs. Patterns should be clear, easy to understand, and work well on both desktop and mobile screens. Both articles emphasize the need to make modals accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. In conclusion, modal panels are useful for grabbing attention or sharing important information, but they must be used with care and designed to fit naturally into the user's process.

                I learned a lot after reading this article. Simple information entry needs to follow rules. The user interface needs to prompt the user about the information and specifications that need to be filled in, otherwise then the end will get messy data. The interface also needs to focus on the user experience and how to give the user a good experience without getting bored when they are faced with a lot of information to fill in. Minimize input fields, step-by-step processing of long forms. Questions tend to range from the simple to the complex, and filling in content often starts with first name and last name. Guide the user through the steps. In simple forms, markers are needed to maintain the user's patience with the necessary information. In a large number of questions, the fill-in box form can guide the user. I don't like the restriction of password formatting when filling out information on websites, even if it is for user security. Most people use the same password for all websites, which is easy to remember. But the restriction of the format would make me break my memory. I have a hard time remembering my password after setting up a new one according to the site's requirements.
