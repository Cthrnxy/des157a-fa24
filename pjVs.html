    <p>This is my page I designed, the first being a mobile page. Based on the switching of the blue ticket, it switches between an image set of photos of the window view and the second half of photos of local food excursions. The computer page is more fun to work with, and I'll create a rotating image of the ticket switching. The first image shown is Guangzhou, the departure point. I'll show some photos of Guangzhou. User action will make the train below move, when the train moves from right to left, the photo group will switch to the photo of the corresponding ticket destination. At the same time, the scenery of the train window will change while the train is moving.</p>
