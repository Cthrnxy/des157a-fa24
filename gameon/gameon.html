        <h1>Alice's wonderland</h1>
        <div>
        <p>Alice finds herself lost in Wonderland, trying to uncover clues for her next adventure. As she wanders through the mysterious forest, she comes across the Cheshire Cat, lounging lazily on a branch.</p>
        <p> “Well, hello there, dear Alice,” the Cheshire Cat says with a sly grin. “I happen to have a clue you need, but if you want it, you'll have to beat me in a game.”</p>
        <p>“What kind of game?” Alice asks, intrigued.</p>
        <p>“The Pig Game,” the Cat replies, its tail curling playfully. “If you win, I'll give you the clue. But if I win...” The Cheshire Cat's grin grows wider. “You'll have to solve an even trickier riddle.”</p>
        <p>Curiosity piqued, Alice agrees to the challenge.</p>
